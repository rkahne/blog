  This is John Yarmuth, Kentucky’s third district Congressman. Since 2012, he’s been the only Democrat in Kentucky’s congressional delegation. Without a doubt, Congressman Yarmuth is the most liberal Kentucky US House Member to have served this century.
While the rest of Kentucky’s delegation has been more conservative than Congressman Yarmuth, I don’t think anyone has ever done any real work to measure the magnitude by which Congressman Yarmuth is the most liberal.

  The women and men who make up the Kentucky legislature use Twitter often to communicate with themselves, their constituents, and Kentuckians as a whole. I analyzed the tweets of the 112 legislators who use the application for sentiment and usage patterns. It was fun project! I learned a lot and I hope you learn something from my work.
Method!The Kentucky Legislative Research Commission director, David Byerman, manages a list of all the Kentucky legislators who use the twitter application.

  Before this year and as far back as anyone can remember, Democrats controlled the Kentucky House of Representatives. Even though no Presidential candidate has carried Kentucky since 1996 and Kentucky has not elected a Democrat to the US Senate since 1992, Democrats in Kentucky have fair better on the state level. However, this ended in 2016, when Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives – what many commenters consider “the last Democratic legislative chamber in the South”.

  A few days ago on twitter, I wrote about some work I had done regarding W-Nominate scores and the Kentucky Legislature. I am getting the sense that many people are confused about what exactly W-Nominate is and how it works. So, allow me to try and explain!
What is W-Nominate?The technical description of W-Nominate, taken directly from their site, is “a scaling procedure that performs parametric unfolding of binary choice data.
